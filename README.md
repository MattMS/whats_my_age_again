Convert values to different [bases (radix)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix).

Open [index.html](./index.html) in a browser and play with the input values.

## Development

Clone the repo then `npm install` to download dependencies.

`npm run build` to rebuild index.html after changing any files.
